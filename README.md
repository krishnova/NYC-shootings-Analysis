# NYC-shootings-Analysis

## About the Project

> This project is an attempt to make New York City safe for the Tourists & Residents by equiping them with all the stats so that they can take the necessary precautions. The dataset contains the details of the various Shooting incidents that took place in New York City in the last 15 years (from 2006 to 2020). An Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed to explore the nature and uncover hidden insights that will help in detection of potential threat locations, the demographics & ethinicity of the victim & the perpretator, and estimation of number of casualties.

## Inspiration 

To explore the following ideas:

• How many people got killed and injured per year?

• Visualize mass shootings on the NYC map

• Is there any correlation between shooter and his/her race, gender

• Any correlation with calendar dates? Do we have more deadly days, weeks or months on average

• Which areas are more prone to such attacks

• Try to find and combine any other external datasets to enrich the analysis

## Objective

I have leveraged the dataset to derive a solution to the following questions:

- Which areas are more unsafe than others?

* Which Age group and Race account for the highest number of Perpetrators?

* Age group and Race account that accounts for the highest number of Victims?

* The exact location that has observed the highest number of incidents?

* Number of incidents that resulted in Murder vs Injuries?

* Most vulnerable Age group?

* Trend of the incidents reported from 2006 to 2020 - which year has observed the highest number of shooting incidents in New York City?

 I've also built a Predictive model to predict the age-group, sex, race of the victim and location of the incident using Random Forest
